# Predicting the next DSAT

The motivation for me to take up this project was solely because it affects a lot on our stacks and the company as well , cause they usually have to pay huge fine because of this. DSAT's can be easily avoided if the Agents push themselvesselves to learn the process well depending on where they feel they lack in

Through this analysis each agent can get an insight and easily make an intuition as to where he/she lacks in and easily decide on which to learn. There are certain issues through which you are more prone to a dsat, keeping that in mind an agent can avoid a dsat.

A small initiative by the agents can make a big difference on the agent's stacks and ultimately the company's revenue. Hope this makes a difference.
